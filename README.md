# HolyScript

## Introduction
HolyScript is a strongly typed, interpretive programming language designed with a unique thematic twist, drawing inspiration from biblical terminology. Aimed at making the learning process more engaging and memorable, HolyScript introduces an innovative syntax and programming concepts that are both educational and fun. Whether you're a beginner looking to understand programming fundamentals or an experienced developer seeking a new perspective, HolyScript offers a fresh and enlightening experience.

## Features
- **Strong Typing**: HolyScript enforces type safety, reducing bugs and runtime errors by ensuring that operations are performed on compatible types.
- **Dynamic Lists**: The language supports dynamic, heterogeneous lists, allowing elements of various types to be stored in a single collection, enhancing flexibility in data manipulation.
- **Unique Syntax**: By incorporating thematic keywords such as `summon` (program start), `doom` (program end), `belief` (if), `chant` (for loop), and `preach` (print), HolyScript offers an engaging way to learn programming constructs.
- **Error Handling**: Implements `trial` and `mercy` for try-catch blocks, making error management intuitive and contextually thematic.
